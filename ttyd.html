                <h1>Narrative</h1>
                <div>
                    <p>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door starts off with Mario receiving a letter from Princess Peach asking him to come to Rougeport, and containing an ancient treasure map she bought there. Before Mario arrives, she gets captured by the X-Nauts, the main antagonists of the game. It’s revealed that the map can show the locations of the seven Crystal Stars, which are required to unlock the Thousand-Year Door underneath Rougeport.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>While Mario embarks on his journey to collect the Crystal Stars, there are intermissions where Peach learns about the X-Nauts plans from where she’s imprisoned in the Moon base. She speaks to the main computer TEC-XX, who falls in love with Peach, and emails her findings to Mario at the end of each intermission.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>After the Peach intermissions are Bowser intermissions, where Bowser, and his right-hand woman Kammy Koopa, set off to get the Crystal Stars before Mario and capture Peach for himself. Bowser normally visits the places Mario has been in the previous chapter, so his search is mostly fruitless.</p>

            <section id="battleMechanics" class="weekStyle">
                <h1>Battle Mechanics</h1>
                <div>
                    <p>Thousand-Year Door takes many of the gameplay mechanics of its predecessor, enhancing them in some cases. He starts with a hammer, and action commands can be done from the start, though he loses the ability to spin-dash. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Unlike the original, partners have their own Heart Points, and therefore can be killed in battle. This means that items, such as healing items like the Mushroom, can be used on them. They also have more specialized abilities available.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Battles are set up on a stage, like a play with an audience of various enemies and allies. The audience can have an effect on the battle, mainly determining how much Star Power - the special form of energy which powers the Special Moves - Mario recovers. The Appeal action or a Stylish move can be used to recover more Star Power, and the various bosses also use the audience, either to consume to recover HP, or to throw at Mario and his partner. The audience can even have an active role in the battle, throwing healing items or trash at Mario and his partner, or even getting on stage to cause props to fall.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The Crystal Stars, as they’re collected, give Special Moves that can be used in battle, consuming SP. They require what amounts to a small minigame and range from moves like Clock Out from the Emerald Star, which immobilizes all the enemies for a few turns, to Power Lift from the Gold Star, which increases Mario and his partner's Attack and Defense Power for a few turns.</p>
                </div>
            </section>
            <section id="worldMechanics" class="weekStyle">
                <h1>Overworld Mechanics</h1>
                <div>
                    <p>In the overworld, besides being able to collect items to be used in battle, and badges to be equipped, each partner also has a special ability which is used to solve a puzzle - such as Koops, a Koopa Troopa, who can use a shell toss to activate switches, grab items, and hit enemies, as well as being able to be thrown backwards.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Mario gains the ability throughout the game to fold into various shapes on special activation panels and use them to get across areas that were previously unreachable. Special pipes also allow Mario to go into the background scenery, though certain abilities are disabled, and Mario can’t walk to a different screen or past any buildings in the foreground.</p>
                </div>
            </section>
            <section id="characterTTYD" class="weekStyle">
                <h1>Characters</h1>
                <div>
                    <p>Visually, many of the partners differ from their non-partner counterparts, such as Admiral Bobbery, a bob-omb who has a large mustache, wears a beat up captains hat that covers one eye, and has a ship wheel on his back. The enemies and the NPCs also differ, either in just coloration, or through the NPCs having more variation or a different outfit from the enemies of the same type.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Each area, differentiated by chapter, has its NPC and enemies. There are overlaps between areas, and the occasional random NPC, but generally they will be grouped to specific areas together. Petalburg, for example, is filled with NPC Koopa Troopas and Toads, while Twilight Town is inhabited by Twiligters, doll-like creatures that get turned into pigs everytime the Creepy Steeple bell rings.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The main antagonists of this game are different. While in the previous game, and most Mario games in general, it was Bowser, in this one it’s the X-Nauts - an evil organization led by Sir Grodus that’s trying to conquer the world. While Bowser is around and is a minor antagonist, the X-Nauts are the ones to capture Peach and be the overarching enemy Mario faces.</p>

            </section>
            <section id="switch" class="weekStyle">
                <h1>Switch Remake</h1>
                <div>
                    <p>Recently, a Switch remake was announced to be released sometime in 2024. Though not much is known about the extent of the changes, it is known from the trailer that the graphics will be updated and enhanced. It still stays faithful to the designs from the original though, characters keeping their designs from the original rather than updated ones from subsequent games - such as Peach, who keeps her previous dress design. The characters are also more expressive, and the graphics have been updated to look more crafted, the paper characters looking to be thicker, nicer paper for example.</p>
